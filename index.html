      There are problems with managing JavaScript projects this way:
      <ul>
        <li>There's an implicit dependency on lodash (no explicit declaration of needing lodash in index.js)</li>
        <li>It is not immediately apparent that the script depends on an external library.</li>
        <li>If a dependency is missing, or included in the wrong order, the application will not function properly.</li>
        <li>If a dependency is included but not used, the browser will be forced to download unnecessary code.</li>
    </ul>
